# My Music App

This is an app to search spotify albums.  <br/>
This page consumes the Spotify API to display album information.
Requests are made to the Spotify API such as adding or removing a saved album, searching for albums. It interacts directly with your account as soon as you authorize it with your spotify username and password. <br/>
It is made with React, Redux and some style libraries.



## `Views`

There is a landing Page where you can log in, there is a section where you can search for albums uploaded to spotify.
 <br/>
There is also a view that allows you to view the favorite albums of your spotify account.<br/>
You can modify your favorites which will also change in your spotify account.

### `Figma`

Use figma to mockup views for both desktop and mobile.  <br/> 
Below I will add the mockups:
<div>
<img height="400" width="700"  src="./readmeImages/Landing.png"/>
<img height="400" width="700" src="./readmeImages/Albums.png"/>
<img height="400" width="700" src="./readmeImages/Favorites.png"/>
<img height="400" width="700" src="./readmeImages/Error404.png"/>
<img height="600" width="350" src="./readmeImages/FavoritesMobile.png"/>
